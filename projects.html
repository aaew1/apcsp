          <p class="p">This was a paper I wrote recently on short-term rentals (STRs) and their contribution to gentrification in cities. We researched the economic ettefts of STRs and found that STRs raise rent prices and property values in the surrounding areas. We then write a report on the issue. I leaarned a lot about STR sites such as Airbnb or Vrbo. I also learned a lot about gentrification, property values, property taxes, city zoning, and construction permits.

          <p class="p">This was a paper I wrote for AP Literature on a complicated issue presented in the epic poem "Paradise Lost" by John Milton. The issue I chose was the portrayal of Satan as a hero. Usually Satan is considered evil however in Pradise Lost, Milton puts Satan in the role of a traditional epic hero. However, Satan still does horrible things such as dooming humanity so that position presents a knotty problem. In the essay I presented all the nuances of this problem. I enjoyed writing this and I learned a lot about epic poetry and the classical era of literature.</p></td>
